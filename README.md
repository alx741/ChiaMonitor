# ChiaMonitor
This is a Chia monitoring solution for people who need to run multiple harvesters on different hosts.
It is based on [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/) (Data Visualization), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/) (Data Persistence & Query), and Mtail (Data Collector, binary file included).

## Features
Check the following screenshot. It provides many useful numbers, and you can set your plot size (`K32` by default) and Netspace Unit (It is increasing so fast!)

## How to Setup
In short, you need to install Grafana & Prometheus on your full node farmer host and install/copy mtail on all the hosts running harvesters.

### On the full node farmer host
This tutorial will not include how to install Grafana & Prometheus, Google is your friend.
One tip is to make sure your port 3000 (Grafana), 9090 (Prometheus), and 3903 (Mtail) can be accessed by others.

After you installed Grafana & Prometheus, modify `prometheus.yml` in the package. Replace the harvester host ip by yours.
Copy `prometheus.yml` to your Prometheus path and run Grafana & Prometheus.

### On the harvestor hosts
Check out the repo on your hosts and run `./run_mtail.sh`. That's it.

Note: if your Chia is not install in `~/` (home directory) you need to modify `run_mtail.sh` with your Chia install path. Make sure all the run_mtail.sh and mtail have execution permission (use chmod command). The mtail version has to be 3.0.0 rc45.

### Import Dashboard in Grafana
I made both English (`grafana_dashboard_en.json`) and Chinese (`grafana_dashboard_zh.json`) versions of the dashboard. You can import them in Grafana.
To open Grafana, use a browser to access your farmer host, e.g. `192.168.0.1:3000`.

After a simple setup you should be able to add data source and import JSON dashboard. It's very straightforward, here are some screenshots.
